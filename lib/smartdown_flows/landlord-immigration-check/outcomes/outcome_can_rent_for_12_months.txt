The person may be able to rent your property.

You must get a positive verification from the [Landlord’s Checking Service](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/test/lcs-no-smart-application.ofml) that the person can rent the property if:

- you're reasonably satisfied that they can't show you their documents because of an outstanding immigration appeal or application with the Home Office
- they have an Application Registration Card
- they have a Certificate of Application that is less than 6 months old

The person will be able to stay in the property for 12 months. You’ll then have to make another check.

##When the person can't rent your property 

The person won’t be able to stay in the property:

- if they don’t have the right documents
- you get a negative result back from the verification check

^You may get a [civil penalty](/penalties-illegal-renting) if you get a Negative Verification notice and you still rent your property to the person who isn't allowed to rent property in the UK.^
