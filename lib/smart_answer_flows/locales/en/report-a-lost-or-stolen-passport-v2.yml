          Your signature will be compared to the signature on the original passport application form. If the original application was made by someone else, you’ll also need to send a signed letter from that person confirming that the passport has been lost or stolen. This is to help prevent child abduction.

          ##Replacing your passport

          You can apply for a replacement at the same time if you’re a British national and in the UK.

          Follow the same process as [renewing a passport](/renew-adult-passport), but you:


          - must send a completed form LS01 with your application (if you haven’t already reported it as lost)
          - must get your application countersigned
          - may be interviewed by Her Majesty's Passport Office to prove your identity
          - may be asked for original supporting documents (eg birth or marriage certificates) when Her Majesty's Passport Office gets your application

          ^Use the [online enquiry form](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/Passport_Enquiries.ofml) to contact Her Majesty’s Passport Office for general advice.

          % You can’t use the [1-day Premium service](/get-a-passport-urgently) if you’re replacing a lost passport. %

          ##If you find your passport

          If you find your passport, don’t sign the form. Instead, return the form in the envelope provided with a signed note confirming that you have found your passport and don’t want to cancel it.
