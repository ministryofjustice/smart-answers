^You must register the birth according to the regulations in %{slug_with_lower_case_prefix(child_country)}.^

You can’t register the birth with the UK authorities. However, the birth certificate you are given in %{slug_with_lower_case_prefix(child_country)} will be recognised and accepted in the UK, so this isn’t necessary.
