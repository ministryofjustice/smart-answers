      body: |
        $!You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.$!

        This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, eg when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it [translated and certified](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document) if it isn’t in English.

        Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You can only do this if the child was born on or after 1 January 1983.

        You don’t need to register with the UK authorities but it means:

        - the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland
        - you can order a consular birth registration certificate

        ^You can still [apply for a UK passport for your child](/apply-renew-passport) even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.^

          You can’t register the birth with the UK authorities. However, the birth certificate you are given in %{registration_country_name_lowercase_prefix} will be recognised and accepted in the UK, so this isn’t necessary.

          You can’t register your child’s birth with the UK authorities abroad. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

          You may still be able to apply for [British citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) for the child.

          You may also be able to register the birth if you’ve married the other parent since the child was born. [Contact your local British embassy](/government/world) to find out.

          You can’t currently register the birth with the UK authorities.

          The local birth certificate, with a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document), should be acceptable for all purposes in the UK. You can apply for registration at any time in the future - check [travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice) to find out if consular services have reopened in %{registration_country_name_lowercase_prefix}.
